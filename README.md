# Array_and_ArrayList
Array and ArrayList Operations in Java
Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental array operations in Java, including:

Separating even and odd numbers into different lists.
Finding two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest difference.
Converting between arrays and ArrayLists.
Each functionality is implemented in modular Java files, following clean coding principles and best practices.

Files and Functionality
1. ArrayFunctions.java
Contains core methods for array operations:

oddEven(int[] array): Separates even and odd numbers into separate lists.
findSmallestDifferenceIndex(int[] array): Finds the index of two neighboring numbers with the smallest difference.
2. UserInput.java
Handles user input:

arrayInput(): Accepts five integers from the user and returns an array.
3. Main.java
The entry point of the program:

Calls arrayInput() to take user input.
Processes the array using oddEven() and findSmallestDifferenceIndex().
Displays the results.
How to Run the Program
1️⃣ Compile the Java files
javac *.java
2️⃣ Run the program
java Main
3️⃣ Enter numbers when prompted
